# Web Development Lab 1 Part 1
### Client-Side Technologies
Firstly I will talk about the Client-Side technologies that may be used to create a website for the 2024 Olympics. Client-Side technologies are usually used to create the front-end of a website, which is what the user sees when they visit the website.

These following technologies could be used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Frameworks (Such as Bootstrap, React)

**HTML and CSS**

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is used to create the content we see on the website such as text, images, videos, etc. 

CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to style the content we see on the website. This allows for the website to look "pretty" and allows for an easier user experience while using the website. CSS is also used to style the HTML content such as changing the font, colour, size, etc.

**JavaScript and TypeScript**

Both Javascript and TypeScript are used to add functionality to a website, aswell as being a scripting language that is used to create and control dynamic website content such as Picture Sildeshows, Graphics, Maps, Animation etc. These languages are almost similar to server-side technologies as they they are used to store data but its on the client-side only.

**Frameworks**

Frameworks are a collection of pre-written code that allows for a developer to create a website in a much faster time. Frameworks such as Bootstrap and React are very popular and are used by many developers to create websites. These are usually a combination of CSS and Javascript with many different functions and classes premade.

### Server-Side Technologies
The next part I will talk about is the Server-Side technologies that may be used to create a website for the 2024 Olympics. Server-Side technologies are usually used to create the back-end of a website, which is what the user doesn't see when they visit the website such as storing data, user authentication, etc.

The following technologies could be used:
- PHP
- Python
- Node.js
- Java
- DataBases (SQL, MongoDB)
- SSL Certificates (HTTPS)
- API (Application Programming Interface)

**PHP**

PHP is a server-side scripting language that is used to create dynamic web pages. PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor and is used to create the back-end of a website where it can be used to store data, user authentication, etc. PHP is a very popular language and is used by many developers to create websites.

**Python**

Python is a server-side scripting language that is used to create dynamic web pages. Python is a very popular language and is used by many developers to create websites as it is very easy to work with and is very powerful. Python can be used to create the back-end of a website where it can be used to store data, user authentication, etc just like PHP. Most commonly Python is used with the Django framework to create websites but Flask applications are also very popular.

**Node.js**

Node is a server-side scripting language that is used to create dynamic web pages. Node is a very popular language and is used by many developers to create websites as it is very easy to work with and is very powerful. Node can be used to create the back-end of a website where it can be used to store data, user authentication, etc just like PHP and Python. Node is usually used with the Express framework to create websites.

**Java**

Java is a server-side scripting language that is used to create dynamic web pages. Java is a very popular language and is used by many developers to create websites as it is very easy to work with and is very powerful. Java can be used to create the back-end of a website where it can be used to store data, user authentication, etc just like PHP, Python and Node. Java is usually used with the Spring framework to create websites.

**DataBases**

Lastly Databases are used to store data for a website. Databases are used to store data such as user information, posts, comments, etc. There are many different types of databases such as SQL and MongoDB. SQL is a relational database and MongoDB is a non-relational database. Databases are usually used with server-side technologies such as PHP, Python, Node and Java to create or store data such as login information, authentication, etc using queries. These can also be used to store information such as results, athletes, etc.

**SSL Certificates**

An SSL Certificate is used to encrypt data sent between the client and the server rather than the data being sent as plaintext. This is used to protect sensitive information such as login information, authentication, etc.

**API**

An API is a set of functions and procedures that allow for the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other services. These are commonly used for functions such as making news reports or anything that the programmer may want to introduce into the website that requires constant updating of new data.

# Web Development Lab 1 Part 2

For this part I'm going to split this up in 2 categories which are:
- Similarities between the websites
- Differences between the websites

**Similarities Between The Websites**

- Both have 2 Navigation Bars with multiple links to different pages, search bar and ability to change language
- Both have a Footer with multiple links to different pages, social media pages, and other pages such as shops, etc
- Both have pictures of athletes and other pictures such as the event venue and news about the event and athletes competing
- Both have support for mobile devices such as phones and tablets
- Both websites have a similar layout and both most likely use the same technologies to create the website. I think both definitely use some sort of database and API to store the results from the event and to upload and store the pictures and videos from the event.


**Differences Between The Websites**

- The Rio 2016 website has a lot more information about the event and athletes competing and allows us to see the highlights of the event and other information such as mascots, medal design and stories that were made from and about the athletes competing
- The Tokyo 2020 website has a lot more pictures from the event and venue and focuses less on the athletes competing and other information such as mascots, medal design and stories that were made from and about the athletes competing
- The Rio 2016 website allows the user to see the results of the event and the athletes competing for every single category while the Tokyo 2020 website shows news about the event and athletes competing instead
- The Tokyo 2020 is more focused on history of the event and the athletes competing while the Rio 2016 website is more focused on the event itself and the athletes competing
