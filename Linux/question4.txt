Commands in linux 
A)To make a directory in home in linux you can use the following two commands where the username is the name the user has given to themeselves while making their user login on the computer: 
  mkdir ~/TUDOP or mkdir /home/username/TUDOP 

B)To make a file in the directory we just created we do the following: 
  cd ~/TUDOP or cd /home/username/TUDOP to enter our directory
  touch File1.txt

C)To check the size of a File1.txt we need to do the following:
  Ensure we are in the directory of the file in this case we do:
  cd ~/TUDOP or cd /home/username/TUDOP
  du -h
  
D)To change the modification time of a file we do the following in linux:
  Ensure we are in the correct directory of the file which we do:
  cs ~/TUDOP or cd /home/username/TUDOP
  
  then we can change the files modification time with:
  touch -t 200411241111 File1.txt

  the time format is in YYYYMMDDHHMM where Y is years, M is months, D is days, H is hours and the last M is minutes.

E) First we need to create the file called File2.txt as follows:
  touch File2.txt

  then we use the command echo -e or printf to add lines of text into the file as follows:
  echo -e "This is line 1!\n This is line 2\nThis is line 3!" >> File2.txt

  or

  printf "This is line1!\nThis is line 2\nThis is line 3!" >> File2.txt

F)To just print out one line in linux we can use the following commands:
  awk 'NR==1' File1.txt

  you can replace the 1 with any number you like in this case it will only display line one of the file. NR stands for number of records(number of lines).

  You can also use the command sed to only display 1 or any lines of text you want:
  sed -n 1p File1.txt for 1 line

  for multiple lines you want you would use this below:
  sed -n -e 1p -e 2p File1.txt 

G)To Append the content of a text file to another text file we do the following:
  cat File1.txt >> File2.txt

  This will append everythin from File1.txt to File2.txt


H)To make a directory in home in linux we can use the two following two commands where the username is the name the user has given to themselves while making their user login on the computer:
  mkdir ~/TUDOP_new_semester or mkdir /home/username/TUDOP_new_semester

I)To copy files over from one directory to the other in linux we use the following command:
  cp -r ~/TUDOP/File1.txt ~/TUDOP/File2.txt ~/TUDOP_new_semester 
  or
  cp -r /home/username/TUDOP/File1.txt /home/username/TUDOP/File2.txt /home/username/TUDOP_new_semester

J) There is multiple ways of deleting files and folders but the easiest way is as follows:
  rm -rf ~/TUDOP or rm -rf /home/username/TUDOP

  this forces the computer to remove all files and folders found inside it and the folder itself -r is a loop which keeps removing files and -f is to force the delete.
